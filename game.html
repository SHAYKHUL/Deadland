            The game is based on a true story. A lonely boy, frustrated and isolated, lived in an old house. 
            He was last seen in his room in 2016, staring into a mirror. Days later, he was found dead. No one knows what happened, 
            but some say the mirror holds his final moments. Now, you have found his diary, and the tasks he left behind…
            <br><br>
            Each task represents a fragment of his tragic story, forcing the player to experience what he went through before his final moments.
